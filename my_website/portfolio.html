        <p id = "reflection">a.The first game I made is a simple which is the wizard chasing the fruits for points. The second game is a chasing game where
          the player is a red dot that being chased by birds and the player have to escape out of the maze before the bird catch them.
          <br><br>b.To create this bird game I mostly use the if-then script, I use it so the player can take damage when touching the bird or stopping the player from
           going over the maze. The second function I used is broadcast, I used this to let player go on to the next level if they succeeded, or go to the game over screen
           if they failed.
           <br><br> c. I have some trouble with the bird flapping animation, I hasn't found a perfect solution to fix it yet. But it is tolerable, I fixed the bird animation by
           make it flapping by 1 second.</p>

        <p id = "reflection">Summary</p>
        <p id = "reflection"> The story is about a student from United State who start a new life in Japan.
          How the student will live will depend on the choice player make. There are only
          one happy ending and the rest is doom. Therefore, choose wisely.</p>
        <p id = "reflection">Reflection</p>
        <p id = "reflection">a. To make this story, I have to learn the basic of python or at least know about the basic of coding.
        <br><br>b. Since this is a basic program, I did not have many big problem with it. But the problem is that I have to watch out
        for where I put in the choice so the story can move on. There are time I put the choice in the wrong part of the story and I have
        to look through the code to see where the choice go. 
        <br><br>c.I have a lot of fun with the story and program, but the part I dislike is the writing since I have to watch out for grammar
        and spelling errors.
        <br><br>d.I particularly like "The Great Escape" and "Hi Miss Nguyen", these story have many choices and result in simple ending.
        <br><br> e. If I had a chance to do my story again then I would like to fix the grammars and find a more clever way to write the story better.</p>
